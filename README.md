## Using Neo4j with this project
(please go and read text file in the appropriate directory)

Consider use 4 main steps :  
### Make the data from SNAP readable for Neo4j  

Use of tools in `shortestpath`. Refer to steps 1 and 2 in the README file in the repository. You have to use Maven to manage depedencies.  
At the end, you must have 3 generated files. Only 2 will be usefull.

### Modify the generated files 

The headers generated by the previous tool is not suitable for importing in Neo4j. It is necessary to modify the headers :

* `node.csv` : use `:ID` for the 1st column
* `relationships.csv`: use `:START_ID`, `:END_ID` and `:TYPE` for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd columns

### Import the data in Neo4j
In order to use the generated data in you instance of Neo4j server, use the `neo4j-import` command.  
When you have started the server using `/bin/neo4j start`, use the following command : 
```
./bin/neo4j-import --into import.db --id-type string --nodes path/to//nodes.csv --relationships path/to/relationships.csv 
``` 
The data for Neo4j is in `import.db`

### (Optionnal) Change the startup database
If `import.db` is not you default database, you can change it by editing the file `conf/neo4j-server.properties` and modify the line :

```
org.neo4j.server.database.location=path/to/import.db

```

## Bonus ! :)
### Styling graph in Neo4j web browser
It may occur that no information are displayed on nodes in a vizualisation window on Neo4j browser. Indeed, we have no information about nodes, except `ID`.  
To display node `ID` you can modify the style file according to following :

	node {
	  /* what is normally */
	  caption: '{id}'
	}
